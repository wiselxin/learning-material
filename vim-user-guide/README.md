# Get start
After you install vim, I do recommand you to following the guide; 
 
- **Open vim** --> input command "vim" at the terminal. 
  
- **Edit a file with vim** --> input command **":e path/file_name"**, the file is opened. but you can not input or change the file. 
because vim open the file and it is under normal mode, when press **'i'**, you will see the **'--insert--'** at bottom of the vim, that means the vim is 'insert' mode. Now you can input something.  
                         
- **Save and exit** --> After you change the file, you need press **'Esc'** to swith 'insert' mode to 'normal'mode. Then input command **':w < enter >'**(write) for save the changes. input **':q < enter >'**(quite) to exit vim. and you can also input command together such as **':wq < enter >'** means save and exit.
